1. Implementation - Login
mandatory
Score: 100.00% (Checks completed: 100.00%)
Objectives
Implement login functionality using the back-end API.
Store the JWT token returned by the API in a cookie for session management.
Requirements
Use the existing login form provided in login.html.
Make an AJAX request to the login endpoint of your API when the user submits the login form.
If the login is successful, store the JWT token in a cookie.
Redirect the user to the main page (index) after a successful login.
Display an error message if the login fails.
Instructions
Setup Event Listener for Login Form:

Add an event listener to the login form to handle the form submission.
Use preventDefault to prevent the default form submission behavior.
Make AJAX Request to API:

Use the Fetch API to send a POST request to the login endpoint with the email and password entered by the user.
Set the Content-Type header to application/json.
Send the email and password in the request body as a JSON object.
Handle API Response:

If the login is successful, store the returned JWT token in a cookie.
Redirect the user to the main page (index.html).
If the login fails, display an error message to the user.
Example Guidance:

scripts.js

Add an event listener for the form submission:
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
      const loginForm = document.getElementById('login-form');

      if (loginForm) {
          loginForm.addEventListener('submit', async (event) => {
              event.preventDefault();
              // Your code to handle form submission
          });
      }
  });
Make the AJAX request to the API:
  async function loginUser(email, password) {
      const response = await fetch('https://your-api-url/login', {
          method: 'POST',
          headers: {
              'Content-Type': 'application/json'
          },
          body: JSON.stringify({ email, password })
      });
      // Handle the response
  }
Handle the API response and store the token in a cookie:
  if (response.ok) {
      const data = await response.json();
      document.cookie = `token=${data.access_token}; path=/`;
      window.location.href = 'index.html';
  } else {
      alert('Login failed: ' + response.statusText);
  }
Testing:
Test the login functionality with valid and invalid credentials to ensure it works as expected.
Verify that the JWT token is stored in the cookie after a successful login.
Ensure that the user is redirected to the main page after login.

Show or hide the login link based on user authentication.
Instructions
Check User Authentication:

On page load, check if the user is authenticated by verifying the presence of the JWT token in cookies.
If the token is not found, show the login link.
If the token is found, hide the login link.
Tip: Use a function to get the value of a cookie by its name.
Fetch Places Data:

Use the Fetch API to send a GET request to the endpoint that returns the list of places.
Ensure the request includes the JWT token for authentication if available.
Tip: Include the token in the Authorization header of your request.
Populate Places List:

Dynamically create HTML elements to display each place’s information (e.g., name, description, location).
Append these elements to the #places-list section.
Tip: Use document.createElement and element.innerHTML to build the place elements.
Implement Client-Side Filtering:

Add an event listener to the country filter dropdown.
Filter the displayed places based on the selected country.
Ensure the filtering works without reloading the page.
Tip: Use element.style.display to show or hide places based on the filter.
Example Guidance
scripts.js

      // Handle the response and pass the data to displayPlaces function
  }
Populate places list:

Create HTML elements for each place and append them to the #places-list.
  function displayPlaces(places) {
      // Clear the current content of the places list
      // Iterate over the places data
      // For each place, create a div element and set its content
      // Append the created element to the places list
  }
Implement client-side filtering:
Add an event listener to the country filter dropdown to filter places based on the selected country.
  document.getElementById('country-filter').addEventListener('change', (event) => {
      // Get the selected country value
      // Iterate over the places and show/hide them based on the selected country
  });
Testing:
Test the functionality by logging in and viewing the list of places.
Verify that the client-side filter works as expected.
Ensure the login link appears only when the user is not authenticated.
